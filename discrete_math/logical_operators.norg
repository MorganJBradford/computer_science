_Negation, Conjunction, and Disjunction_

There are 6 logical operators that wel will focus on:

~ Negation
~ Conjunction
~ Disjunction
~ Exclusive Or
~ Implication
~ Biconditional

$ Compound propositions are formed by combining simple propositions using logical operators. \

* Negation:
  > Let p be a proposition. ~p is called negation of p which simyl states that
  >> "It is not the case that p"
  > if p is true then ~p is false and vice versa.
* Conjunction:
  > Let p and q be two propositions. Conjunction of p and q is donoted by p ^ q
  > When both p and q are true then only the compound proposition p ^ q is true.
** Both 'but' and 'and' are used to represent conjunction.
* Disjunction:
  > Let p and q be two propositions. The XOR of p and q (denoted by p âŠ• q) is a proposition that simply means that exactly one of p and q will be true but both cannot be true at the same time.
** Either 'or' or 'but not both' are used to represent disjunction.
