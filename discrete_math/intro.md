# _Introduction to Discrete Mathematics_

## What is Discrete Mathematics?

<dl>
    <dt>Discrete Mathematics:</dt>
    <dd>Discrete Mathematics is the study of discrete objects.</dd>
    <dd>Discrete means: "distinct or not connected".</dd>
    <dd>It is not a branch of Methematics. It is rather a description of a set of branches that have one common property - that they are "discrete" and not "continuous".</dd>

1. Discrete vs Continuous
    - The whole world of Mathematics is divided in two realms:
       - Discrete Mathematics
       - Continuous Mathematics
2. Discrete Objects:
    - Natural Numbers
        - Graph Repersentation:
    - Digital Clocks are discrete objects.
3. Continuous Objects:
    - Real Numbers
        - Graph Represation:
            - Lines, Curves, Surfaces
        - Analog Clocks are continuous objects.
