_Motivation and Introduction to Propositional Logic_

The phrase propositional logis is composed of two words:

<dl>
    <dt>Propositional:</dt>
    <dd>A statement that can be either true or false.</dd>
    <dt>Logic:</dt>
    <dd>
        Logic is the science of reasoning.
        <ul>
            <li>It helps us to understand and reason about different mathematical statements.</li>
            <li>With rules of logic, we would be able to think about mathematical statements and finally we would be able to prove or disprove those mathematical statements precisely.</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>

For example:
- Rules of logic enable us to reason about the mathematical statements like:
- "For every positive integer n, the sum of positive integers not exceeding n is $n(n+1)/2$"
- _Either it is a valid mathematical argument or it is an invalid argument._

Purpose of logic is to construct valid arguments (or proofs).
Once we prove a mathematical statement is true we call it a theorem.
This is the basis of all mathematics.

Example 2:
**Famous Knights and Knaves Puzzle**
"In in Island there are two kind of inhabitants, Knights, who always tell the truth, and their opposites, Knaves, who always lie. You encounter two people Alice and Bob. Who are Alice and Bob if Alice says 'Bob is a Knight' and Bob says 'The two of us are opposite types'?"

These types of problems can be very easily solved using propositional logic.

# Propositional Logic:
## What is proposition?
<dl>
    <dt>Proposition:</dt>
    <dd>Proposition is a <em>declarative sentence</em> (a sentence that is declaring a fact or stating an argument) which can be either true or false but not both.</dd>
    <dd> Area of logic that studies ways of joining and/or modifying propositions to form more complicated propositions and it also studios the logical relationships and properties derived from these combined/altered propositions.</dd>
</dl>

## Compound Propositions:
### Why do we need compound propositions?
#### To express more complex ideas.
#### To express relationships between simple propositions.

# Propositional Variables:
## Which on of the following is convenient to express:
> "Adam is good in playing football and this time he is representing his college at National level."
OR
> if p = Adam is good in playing football
> q = this time he si representing his college at National level.
> p $\land$ q $\leftarrow$ p and q are variables.

- Variables that are used to represent propositions are called Propositional Variables.
