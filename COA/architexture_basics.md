Computer Archicecture:
: It is the design of computers, including their instruction sets, hardware components and system organization.

There are two main components of computer architecture:
1. Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
2. Hardware System Architecture (HSA)

Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):
: The interface between the hardware and the software. It is the set of instructions that a computer can execute. It is the most important abstraction in computer architecture.
: It is the boundary between the hardware and the software. It is the contract between the hardware and the software

Hardware System Architecture (HSA):
: It is the actual hardware implementation of the computer. It includes the components like CPU, memory, I/O devices, etc.

Instruction Set Architecture:
```
MOV R1, O2H
MOV r2, 03H
ADD R1, R2
STORE X, R1
```

Hardware System Architecture:

_History_

> Analytical Engine (1837) - Charles Babbage:
>> First general-purpose computer
>> Assisted by Ada Lovelace
>>> First one to propose programming languages
>>> Was tutored by Augustus De Morgan
>>>> De Morgan's Laws revulutionized Boolean Algebra (George Boole)
> Alan Turing (1936) - Computability and Non-Computability
> Johann Von Neumann (1945) - Stored Program Concept
>> Child prodigy
>> Was able to divide 8 digit numbers by 8 digit numbers at the age of 6
>> Worked full time at Princeton by the age of 30
>> Proposed the Von Neumann Architecture
>>> Offered Turing a research assistant position under his supervision in quantum mechanics at the intitute of advanced studies

Family Tree of Computer Science - Professor Brailsford: \
???? "If Turing is the father and and Babbage is the grandfather, Ada Lovelace is the great aunt, Neumann was the impossibley rich and clever uncle of computer science."
