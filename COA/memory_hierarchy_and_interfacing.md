# Memory Interfacing:
  - Part of Computer Organization.
  - Deals with the way of connecting various level of Memory units to Processor & I/O peripherals.
  - The speed of the processor is counted using the unit MIPS.

  $ MIPS: Million Instructions Per Second

  nth Level âŠ† (n+1)th Level

  CPU |----> nth level |----> (n+1)th level
  - if data is found in nth level, then it is called as Hit.
  - if data is not found in nth level, then it is called as Miss then move to (n+1)th level.

  Method 1 of interfacing:
## CPU is connected to all levels of memory simultaneously.
## When the CPU wants to access the data, it will check in all levels of memory.

### If we have memory units:
#### M1, M2, M3
### Acces Time:
#### T1, T2, T3
##### T1 < T2 < T3
### Hit Ratio:
#### H1, H2, H3
##### H1 > H2 > H3

### This is known as Effective/Average Memory Acces Time (T_{avg}):
#### $H_1 T_1 + ((1-H_1)\cdot H_2) T_2 + ((1-H_1) \cdot (1-H_2))T_3$

^ Because the memory units are connected to the CPU simultaneously, which is why these checks will run in parallel.
- So, the time taken to access the data will be the time taken to access the data from the memory unit which has the highest hit ratio.

     > Total no. of Instructions = 100
     > No. of Instructions found in nth level = 80
     > MM's Hit Ratio = 80/100 = 0.8 = 80%


     Method 2 of interfacing:
## CPU is connected to only one level of memory at a time.
## When the CPU wants to access the data, it will check in the memory unit which is connected to the CPU.
### Effective Memory Access Time (T avg):
#### $H_1H_1 + ((1-H_1) \cdot H_2) (H_1+T_2) + ((1-H_1) \cdot (1-H_2)) (H_1+T_2+T_3)$

## Memory Interfacing - Solved PYQs

Q1:
>A cache memory needs an access time of 30 ns and main memore of 150 ns, what is the average access time of CPU (assume hit ration = 80%)?

## Solutions
### Solution 1:

Assume both the cache and main memory are simultaneously connected to the proccesor.

| Access Time | Hit Ratio |
|-------------|-----------|
| $T_{cache} = 30 \ ns$ | $H_{cache}$ = 80% = 0.8 |
| $T_{MM} = 150 \ ns$ |
| $T_{avg} = H_{cache}T_{cache} + (1-H_{cache})T_{MM} \\ = 0.8 \cdot 30 + (1-0.8)\cdot150 \ ns \\ = 24 + 0.2 \cdot 150 = 54\ ns$ |

### Solution 2:

Assume only one memory unit is connected to the CPU at a time.
- Level wise organization

| Access Time | Hit Ratio |
|-------------|-----------|
| $T_{cache} = 30 \ ns$ | $H_{cache}$ = 80% = 0.8 |
| $T_{MM} = 150 \ ns$ |
| $T_{avg} = H_{cache}T_{cache} + (1-H_{cache})(T_{cache}+T_{MM}) \\ = 0.8 \cdot 30 + (1-0.8)(30+150) \ ns \\ = 24 + 0.2 \cdot 180 = 24 + 36 = 60\ ns$ |

Q2:
> Assume that for a certain processor, a read request takes 50 ns on a cache miss and 5 ns on a cache hit.
> Suppose while running a program, it was observed that 80% of the processor's read requests result in a cache hit.
> The average read access time in ns is:

| Access Time | Hit Ratio |
|-------------|-----------|
| $T_{cache}+T{MM} = 50\ ns$ | $H_{cache}$ = 80% = 0.8 |
| $T_{cache} = 5\ ns$ |
| $H_{cache}T_{cache} + (1-H_{cache})(T_{cache}+T_{MM}) \\ = 0.8 \cdot 5 + (1-0.8)\cdot 50\ ns \\ = 4 + 0.2 \cdot 50 = 4 + 10 = 14\ ns$ |
