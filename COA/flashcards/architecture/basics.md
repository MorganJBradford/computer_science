#flashcards/architecture/basics
Computer Archicecture::It is the design of computers, including their instruction sets, hardware components and system organization.

#flashcards/architecture/basics
What are the two main components of computer architecture:
?
1. Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
2. Hardware System Architecture (HSA)

#flashcards/architecture/basics
Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
?
- The interface between the hardware and the software. It is the set of instructions that a computer can execute. It is the most important abstraction in computer architecture.
- It is the boundary between the hardware and the software. It is the contract between the hardware and the software

#flashcards/architecture/basics
Hardware System Architecture (HSA)::It is the actual hardware implementation of the computer. It includes the components like CPU, memory, I/O devices, etc.

Instruction Set Architecture example:
?
MOV R1, O2H
MOV R2, 03H
ADD R1, R2
STORE X, R1
