# Cache Memory
- Generally comprised of 3 levels:
  - L1 Cache
  - L2 Cache
  - L3 Cache


  Dual core, quad core, and octa core processors belong to MIMD (Multiple Instruction Multiple Data) architecture in Flynn's taxonomy.
  Each core has its own L1 cache. All cores share the L2 cache. The L3 cache is shared by all cores.

  L1 Cache is embedded in the processor chip. It is the fastest cache memory. It is also the smallest in size.

  When L2 cache emerged, it was incorporated in the motherboard but now it is also embedded in the processor chip.

  Different processor cores have their own L2 and L2 caches.

  L3 cache is embeded in the processor but is shared by all cores.
